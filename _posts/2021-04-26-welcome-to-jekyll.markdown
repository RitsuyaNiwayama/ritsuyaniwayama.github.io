Opening a blog in which I can write about math is what I wanted to do these days. To do so, combining Jekyll and MathJax is a nice way.

One advice to do so is to read well [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] and [MathJax website][mathjax-web] because they show the newest information. 

Finally you will be able to use mathematical characters 
$$ x = y^5 $$
like this.

Good luck!
